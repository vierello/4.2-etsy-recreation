# Etsy Recreation

### This is a recreation of the Etsy website, with a search parameter of sports cards.

### I built this application in week 4 to practice pulling JSON data from an API, and
### using the data to populate the screen using handlebars to create templates.

For this project we used the Etsy API with a search term that we decided on, to
pull in a bunch of JSON data and use the date to recreate the Etsy page as closely as
possible using handlebars to create templates and bootstrap to layout the page to
display the data.
